# Change Log

## Unreleased

## 0.18.0
* update to wgpu 22.1.0, by @waywardmonkeys in [#75](https://github.com/Wumpf/wgpu-profiler/pull/75)

## 0.17.0
* update to wgpu 0.20
* `GpuTimerQueryResult` are now also produced when timing is disabled for that scope
  * `GpuTimerQueryResult::time` is an `Option` now
* update tracy client to 0.17.0

## 0.16.2

* Updating to wgpu 0.19.3 thus removing the need for pinned web-sys, by @xStrom in [#65](https://github.com/Wumpf/wgpu-profiler/pull/65)

## 0.16.1

* Fix building for wasm, by @davidster in [#62](https://github.com/Wumpf/wgpu-profiler/pull/62)

## 0.16

* update to wgpu 0.19
* ⚠️ Includes many major breaking changes! ⚠️
  * `GpuProfiler` can now be used with several command buffers interleaved or in parallel!
    * `Scope`/`OwningScope`/`ManualScope`/ are now all top-level in the `gpu_profiler` module. `GpuProfiler` has utilities to create them directly.
  * `GpuProfiler::begin_query` returns a query and `GpuProfiler::end_query` consumes it again
  * nesting of profiling scopes is no longer done automatically: To manually associate a `GpuProfilerQuery` with a parent, use `GpuProfilerQuery::with_parent`
  * removed profiling macro (doesn't work well with the new nesting model)
  * `GpuProfiler` can now directly create scope structs using `GpuProfiler::scope`/`owning_scope`

## 0.15

* update to wgpu 0.18, by @Zoxc in [#50](https://github.com/Wumpf/wgpu-profiler/pull/50)
* sample & doc fixes, by @waywardmonkeys in [#41](https://github.com/Wumpf/wgpu-profiler/pull/41), [#44](https://github.com/Wumpf/wgpu-profiler/pull/44)
* various methods return `thiserror` errors instead of internal unwrap/except on user errors, by @Wumpf in [#45](https://github.com/Wumpf/wgpu-profiler/pull/45) and following PRs
* overhauled `GpuProfiler` creation & configuration:
  * takes settings object that can be changed after the fact (allows disabling on the fly!)
  * adapter/queue/device no longer needed on creation unless tracy client is required.
  * separate creation method for tracy support
